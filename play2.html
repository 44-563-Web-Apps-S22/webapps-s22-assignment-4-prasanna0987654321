            SCENE III.--HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, VALÃˆRE, MASTER JACQUES.
        </p>
        <h6 class="harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">Come, come near, and confess the most abominable action, the most
            horrible crime, that was ever committed.</p>
        <h6 class="valere name">VAL.</h6> <p class="speech">What do you want, Sir?.</p>
        <h6 class="harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech"> What, wretch! you do not blush for shame after such a crime?</p>
        <h6 class="valere name">VAL.</h6> <p class="speech">Of what crime do you speak?.</p>
        <h6 class="harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">Of what crime I speak? Base villain, as if you did not know what
            I mean! It is in vain for you to try to hide it; the thing is
            discovered, and I have just heard all the particulars. How could you
            thus abuse my kindness, introduce yourself on purpose into my house to
            betray me, and to play upon me such an abominable trick? </p>
            <h6 class="valere name">VAL.</h6> <p class="speech">Sir, since everything is known to you, I will neither deny what I
                have done nor will I try to palliate it.</p>

        <h6 class="jacques name">JAC.</h6><p class="direction">(_aside_)
           
        </p> <p class="speech">Oh! oh! Have I guessed the truth?.</p>
