        <p class="direction"> SCENE II HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES.</P>
            <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">I am coming back. Have his throat cut at once; have his
 feet singed; put him in boiling water, and hang him up to the ceiling.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech"> What! Him who has robbed me?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent
 me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech"> This is no longer the question; and you have to speak of
 something else to this gentleman.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" the police officer name">OFF.</h6> <p class = "direction">(_to_JACQUES).</p><p class ="speech"> Don't get frightened. I am not a man to cause any
 scandal, and matters will be carried on by gentle means.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class = "direction">(_to_ HARPAGON).</p><p class="speech">  Is this gentleman coming to supper with you?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" the police officer name">OFF.</h6> <p class ="speech"> You must, in this case, my good man, hide nothing from your master</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech"> Indeed, Sir, I will show you all I know, and will treat you in the best manner I possibly can.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" the police officer name">OFF.</h6> <p class ="speech"> That's not the question.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech"> If I do not give as good fare as I should like, it is the fault
 of your steward, who has clipped my wings with the scissors of his economy.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech"> Rascal! We have other matters to talk about than your supper; and I want you to tell me what has become of the money which has been
 stolen from me.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech"> Some money has been stolen from you?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech"> Yes, you rascal! And I'll have you hanged if you don't give it me back again.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" the police officer name">OFF.</h6> <p class = "direction">(_to_ HARPAGON).</p><p class ="speech">   Pray, don't be hard upon him. I see by his looks
 that he is an honest fellow, and that he will tell you all you want to
 know without going to prison. Yes, my friend, if you confess, no harm
 shall come to you, and you shall be well rewarded by your master. Some
 money has been stolen from him, and it is not possible that you know
 nothing about it.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6><p class = "direction">(_aside_).</p> <p class="speech"> The very thing I wanted in order to be revenged of our
 steward. Ever since he came here, he has been the favourite, and his
 advice is the only one listened to. Moreover, I have forgotten neither
 the cudgelling of to-day nor ...</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  What are you muttering about there?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" the police officer name">OFF.</h6><p class = "direction"> (_to_ HARPAGON).</p><p class ="speech">  Leave him alone. He is preparing himself to
 satisfy you; I told you that he was an honest fellow.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">  Sir, since you want me to tell you what I know, I believe it is
 your steward who has done this.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  Val√®re?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech"> Yes.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  He who seemed so faithful to me!</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">  Himself. I believe that it is he who has robbed you.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  And what makes you believe it?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">  What makes me believe it?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  Yes.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech"> I believe it...because I believe it.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" the police officer name">OFF.</h6> <p class ="speech"> But you must tell us the proofs you have.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  Did you see him hanging about the place where I had put my money?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech"> Yes, indeed. Where was your money?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech"> In the garden.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">  Exactly; I saw him loitering about in the garden; and in what was
 your money?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  In a casket.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech"> The very thing. I saw him with a casket.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech"> And this casket, what was it like? I shall soon see if it is
 mine.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech"> What it was like?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  Yes.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">  It was like ... like a casket.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" the police officer name">OFF.</h6> <p class ="speech">  Of course. But describe it a little, to see if it is the same.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">  It was a large casket.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech"> The one taken from me is a small one.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">  Yes, small if you look at it in that way; but I call it large
 because of what it contains.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  And what colour was it?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">   What colour?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" the police officer name">OFF.</h6> <p class ="speech">  Yes.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech"> Of a colour ... of a certain colour.... Can't you help me to find
 the word?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  Ugh!</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">  Red; isn't it?</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech"> No, grey.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class="speech">  Ha! yes, reddish-grey! That's what I meant.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" harpagon name">HAR.</h6> <p class="speech">  There is no doubt about it, it's my casket for certain. Write
 down his evidence, Sir! Heavens! whom can we trust after that? We must
 never swear to anything, and I believe now that I might rob my own
 self.</p>
 
 <h6 class=" jacques name">JAC.</h6> <p class = "direction">(_to_ HARPAGON).</p><p class="speech">. There he is coming back, Sir; I beg of you not
 to go and tell him that it was I who let it all out, Sir.</p>
